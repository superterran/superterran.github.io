[{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"A few years back I spent a good bit of time with Jekyll, a static-site generator that is compatible with github-pages. Static-site generators have fascinated me every since. I work professionally with Magento, which takes a lot of effort to host well. With something like Jekyl or Hugo, the infrastructure needs reduce dramatically as you only need to serve a few html files ultimately. I\u0026rsquo;m also a giant devops geek, so I always jump at the chance to build some continuous delivery workflows.\nA little History\u0026hellip; A few things have changed since the last time I worked on this blog. Back in the day, Github Actions didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, so your ability to heap features onto Jekyll were limited. This led me to using Netlify to do my building and hosting, which honestly was fine. I event learned a little ruby along the way. But times change\u0026hellip; we can use actions to use any tool we want to populate github.io. I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to spent a lot of time with a four-year-old tool and repo, so I looked into what the kids were using. I played with a few options, and Hugo really stood out.\nWhy Hugo? First, Hugo is fast. Github actions are completing in 5-10 seconds. This is as close to real-time as I need, especially coming from a world where Bitbucket Pipelines or Netlfy builds take a minute before they even start!\nSecond, it\u0026rsquo;s really simple. Probably the one thing that convinced me to go with it is this Hugo Example Repo, where there\u0026rsquo;s no theme files - just the meta files. While this level of separation is important to me, I actually wanted to completely de-couple the content from the rest of the codebase, and this didn\u0026rsquo;t go far enough, but it\u0026rsquo;s nice that Hugo likes git submodules because this made going all the way fairly easy.\nThird, I like how customizable it is. It supports widgets (blocks you can move around), it supports like four varieties of config files. While most of these static site generators support markdown, this will take many files you throw at it, and it\u0026rsquo;s markdown files don\u0026rsquo;t need grey-matter, which I found is a barrier to blogging that mostly stopped me.\nArchitecture Like I mentioned earlier, I\u0026rsquo;m using a github action to run the hugo build and populate the gh-pages branch which gets served by github.io. I was able to find an action file that does this out the box, but I modified it to run git submodule update so that it pulls in the latest content from my blog repo. I also added a RepositoryDispatch trigger, and in my blog repo I added an action that triggers it I can deploy by updating either repo.\nContent Management This is where I felt my Jekyll instance fell short. I tried using Prose and Forestry, and this week I looked into Netlify CMS to find some frontend to manage this well. But of course, the whole draw of markdown is supposed to be how ambiguous it is. The problem is that with my Jekyll site, you needed a bunch of custom front-matter. This meant you needed a frontend that managed the grey-matter, which meant you were screwing with that the whole time.\nThe front-matter problem also had me take a long-hard look at what I\u0026rsquo;m tracking, and make some executive decisions about the data I track. I decided that, by default, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer not to have any front-matter, that an empty markdown file with just content should post. This took a few template tweaks, but was not hard. I even went so far as to have it prefer the filename for the title field (you will notice my filenames contain caps, spaces, some special characters). This seems to work, and from a style stand-point makes it very obvious on how to create content. Just removing friction. To this end, I choose a template that requires little to no imagery, this will be a text based blog moving forward primarily.\nIn other parts of my life, I\u0026rsquo;ve started using Mark Text as a general-purpose note taking app, where my ~/Documents directory just has directories-upon-directories of markdown files. This is easy to maintain, it\u0026rsquo;s great. So with this, I\u0026rsquo;ve cloned superterran/blog to ~/Documents, and I added a script ~/bin/publish that commits the contents and pushes it up.\n#!/bin/bash cd ~/Documents/Blog git pull git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;publish command ran on $(whoami)@$(hostname)on $(date)\u0026#34; git push Conclusion So far, I think it\u0026rsquo;s great. The builds are super-fast, the content is well separated from the app, the hosting is free, and everything is built around markdown. What\u0026rsquo;s not to like? If you want to learn more or check under the hood, check it out on GitHub!\n","ref":"/making-a-home-in-hugo/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"I started using GNOME 40 about a month back, just as Fedora 34 went into beta. The latest release is really something great. Huge fan of the gorgeous activities overview.

Bottom triggers Activities overview is another favorite, this predictably sets a new hot-trigger when you move the mouse to the bottom of the screen, where the dock is now placed. Really ties the whole interface together.\nThe overviews interface is clearly the biggest improvement, but I also like the new power management profiles they have baked into the settings menu, and finally being able to organize the apps menu is nice as well. In all, GNOME seems to be tracking well with Mac OS releases and they have currently caught us to OS X Lion.\nThis is a great release, but still - would it kill the GNOME team to introduce some translucent blur!\n","ref":"/never-stop-defending-gnome/"},{"title":"Contact","date":"","description":"Reach out to me for any reason!","body":"I\u0026rsquo;m pretty friendly once you get to know me\u0026hellip;\n","ref":"/about/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"With ChromeOS 75 hitting the dev channel, we\u0026rsquo;re starting to see budding 3D support on the Pixel Slate. It\u0026rsquo;s still unstable, and not a lot works with it, but it may be worth playing around with if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in gaming on this great little tablet.\nA small primer, ChromeOS has it\u0026rsquo;s own developer shell that you can access by typing Ctrl+Alt+T. This opens in a new tab.\nIf you install Crostini, the Linux subsystem, you should have a command called vmc. If you run vmc list you will see a listing of the linux containers, termina is an option, if you click on the Terminal icon in your app drawer, this terminal is where you\u0026rsquo;re dropped into.\nYou can enable gpu support by stopping the running container with vmc stop termina, and then vmc start --enable-gpu termina. This should drop you into a crostini shell with gpu enablement. Hit Ctrl-D to drop from this. At this point, you can launch Terminal or Steam from the App drawer and you should be accelerated.\nSupposedly you can confirm this by running glxinfo -B and confirming it\u0026rsquo;s using virgl. My system hangs on this command, but I will update when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Little Interno as a demo for GPU support, in software rendering this is a very choppy experience, but the touch controls all work great. With 3d support enabled, it runs very smoothly and still with great touch support. With 3D support enabled, Civ 5 finally launches and can play a game, albeit it\u0026rsquo;s very slow. Folks online tell me that their Pixelbook runs Civ 5 well, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time!\n","ref":"/crostini-gpu-acceleration-and-steam/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned this year is that I\u0026rsquo;m a toxic Star Trek fan. According to Shit Posters, both the Facebook group and Reddit commentor variety, I endlessly critique bothersome details and in doing so miss out on all the wonder and spectacle. Perhaps my adulation of TNG era Trek, knowing all the tapes and my reverence to all mighty Canon has poisoned me? Am I incapable of enjoying new Trek?\nThe last week, the lady and I have been watching the Star Trek movie collection. Star Trek II is glorious, the scenes with Ricardo Montalb√°n, his revenge orgasms are the stuff of legend.\nBut how did I feel about Into Darkness? Predictably, I hated the casting of Kahn. Some British white guy? What were they thinking?! Looks nothing like the man, much less act like him. I recall predicting before the movie that Kahn was going to be part of Section 31 somehow. Gladly I was right, a dirty admiral with a secret agenda. Not exactly Sloane, but didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt the movie at all. Fast forward a few years, Section 31 is mainstream. Discovery has a Section 31 officer, is being chased around by Section 31 ships, hell the whole Federation is taking orders from a Section 31 AI. All this from an organization so obscure they didn\u0026rsquo;t even give themselves a name. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m sensitive to this point, I did after all watch DS9 like six times.\nStar Trek IV, the Whale one, is probably my favorite overall. It\u0026rsquo;s also the worst offender, in terms of groan moments. There\u0026rsquo;s a scene where someone just walks into a Cloaked landing strut that was right in front of them, perfectly transparent. This is a fowl, of course, it\u0026rsquo;s not like when you cloak a Klingon vessel the ship just turns invisible like The Justice Leauge Jet. There\u0026rsquo;s a light-bending field around it, it\u0026rsquo;s circular, you see it on monitors. In Star Trek III, the same cloaking device didn\u0026rsquo;t fool Kirk out in open space, he and Sulu saw a distortion on a view screen and realized a ship was there.\nIf there was a cloaked ship just on earth, sitting in a grassy park somewhere, it\u0026rsquo;s going to stand out. At least that\u0026rsquo;s what the rest of Trek canon says, except for in this movie where it\u0026rsquo;s fun to watch someone bump into it or to watch Sulu lower plexiglass into thin air. As I said, it\u0026rsquo;s my favorite one of the lot. I pointed out to Trina these little flaws, or how Scotty just typed for 20 seconds and had that Macintosh cut a backflip. I loved every minute of it.\nAnd lest we forget, the all-important warp crystals, which they had to figure out how to recharge. Luckily, in the 20th century, we used dumpy nuclear reactors for everything and somehow waving a dilithium crystal in front of them charges them right up. Who knew? Last time, on Discovery, Pike obtained a Time Crystal from a Klingon Monastery. I, of course, held my tongue. But the toxic fanboys were livid! I was among them. Time Crystals are a lazy cop-out, especially for a universe where Time Travel was totally possible. Just watched them do it in IV, in a garbage Klingon vessel.\nTime Crystals. The DS9 tie-ins to Bajoran Orbs were obvious. There was a line, something like \u0026lsquo;what you see is for you and you alone\u0026rsquo; that was the writer boldly stating that I should just accept this as happening. But I can\u0026rsquo;t. Yes, yes, warp crystals are fine. For you see, they have written books of techno-babble to explain how they take matter and anti-matter, shunt it through some crystal, creating a warp field that compresses space-time in front of the ship and expanding it behind, sweet technobabble. When the HMS Bounty (Kirk\u0026rsquo;s Klingon ship in IV) shot off into Time Warp, they just needed some math, a gravity well, and a high warp factor. No need for time crystals. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget about the Assignment: Earth episode.\nWhen DS9 introduced the Bajoran Orbs, they weren\u0026rsquo;t just trodding on mysticism. Sisko didn\u0026rsquo;t see the Orb of Time as something that defied all logic and being. He recognized that The Worm Hole Aliens exist outside of our timeframe, they see past and future all at once. The Orb was a conduit to that perspective. The religious aspect was always deconstructed, a tricorder was always introduced, and an attempt was made to reconcile it to the universe the writers constructed, one fixed in science.\nThe best part of Discovery is there are subtle little clues that they are listening. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that the writers are all Star Trek gurus and know the material far better than I ever will. The show is still ongoing, the hope that they cleverly tie up some loose ends, nod that they have to fit into canon and can\u0026rsquo;t simply re-write it keeps me going. Time Crystals and a Klingon Monetary protecting them might just be the dumbest idea I\u0026rsquo;ve seen thus far, but if Babylon 5 has taught us anything it\u0026rsquo;s that a good time-loop can fill a lot of gaps. Hell, it could even explain why Section 31 is so invasive. And with a technological stepping back as we deal with the aftermath of Control, we could even explain why the Enterprise looks primitive comparatively.\nSo in all, still pretty toxic. But I acknowledge the possibility that the show could bend towards the kind of Trek I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. Someone said that I want Disco to be a dog, but it\u0026rsquo;s a cat, and I need to accept it as a cat. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I agree. Discovery might not need my fandom, but if it wants it, it\u0026rsquo;ll have to earn it as all the rest of the franchise did. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it wants to the show I want it to be, but there\u0026rsquo;s still time if it does. I keep reminding myself TNG wasn\u0026rsquo;t even watchable until Season 3. Anything could happen.\n","ref":"/star-trek-discovery-a-bitter-analysis/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"I\u0026rsquo;ve owned many tablets. My first tablet ran Windows 7 and was absymal. I recall my first Android tablet running Honeycomb, which didn\u0026rsquo;t really spark joy, as they say. The first tablet I ever liked was a Surface Pro 4, but I spilled some water on it and killed it. My last tablet, a Samsung TabPro running Windows 10 was my running favorite; it was the best of the Surface, but with USB-C and a thinner, lighter build. It was great at everything, except Windows kinda sucks at power management still, and Chrome was a slow resource hog.\nEnter Pixel Slate, where Chrome is a first class citizen finally and if I live within it I can generally expect 10-15 hours of battery life. These are estimates I could only dream of on any Windows device, let alone a Surface. It\u0026rsquo;s power management is great, too. On a Surface, if you leave the thing lying around for a week you can expect it to be dead unless you configure it to go into hybernation. Even then, it takes minutes to boot and oftentimes doesn\u0026rsquo;t even work. If you want to try and save the battery if you pick it up and put it down alot, there\u0026rsquo;s really no good configuration. With the Slate, where there is no configuration for this at all, it just naturally acts like it\u0026rsquo;s always on and hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a problem. You can walk away from it for a week, come back and see it\u0026rsquo;s at 70% (which is like 8-9 hours).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had the Slate for a couple of months now, but when I was considering it there really wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of press on it. The famous MKBHD video destorying the Celeron version was out, and many other review videos on specifically the Celeron version. By the time I worked up the nerve to buy one, Best Buy was only selling the m3 model. So I picked one up, and it was perfectly fine. My biggest concern was Crostini, the Linux layer that\u0026rsquo;s getting GPU support and already can run most Steam games, and it worked. It didn\u0026rsquo;t feel slow, but the Shell, the desktop experience, felt very half-baked. Chrome itself could fly, but doing anything in the OS was laggy and slow. I\u0026rsquo;m a Linux user, at heart. I expect things to be half-baked, so I hedged by bets, returned the m3 and bought and i5, and here I am several months later. There still isn\u0026rsquo;t GPU support for Crostini, but it\u0026rsquo;s coming. It runs Docker though, and well enough I can replicate my work dev setup on my tablet without much effort. Pretty cool.\nThe biggest difference between a Windows tablet and say ChromeTab is the applications. Modern Windows Apps are cool and all, but nobody uses them and the store is an utter wasteland. You certainly not likely to find the control app for my TV, or your doorlock, or even your lightbulbs in a Windows store. No, those kinds of things are targeted towards Android and iOS. Luckilly, ChromeOS runs Android, making it dramatically more useful than a Windows system. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you the impression that it runs Android apps well, but it does run them, and for a device I mostly use in the Living Room this is a good thing.\nIn all, the hardware is great. The keyboard cover is what it is. The software could stand some improvements, but it runs Chrome better than a Surface, and that should be a convincing sell for most people. If you own a Surface, and you use Chrome for the most part, and realize you can\u0026rsquo;t swype-type a sentence into a textbox in your browser and that bugs you, then this is basically the only option. Or switching to Edge. It\u0026rsquo;s adopting Chrome, you know. I just like the Slate hardware better. If the software doesn\u0026rsquo;t pan out, it looks like you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to install Windows 10 on it soon enough.\n","ref":"/living-with-a-pixel-slate/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"It\u0026rsquo;s fair to say gnome-shell is, and always has been, polarizing. There\u0026rsquo;s folks like me who love it and think it\u0026rsquo;s picked up Apple\u0026rsquo;s mantle of driving the workstation desktop. There are others who see it as a spartan waste of good screen real estate. These two perspectives are at odds, and the GNOME community has gained a reputation for dismissing the latter and shoving the former down everyone\u0026rsquo;s throats. If you spend a few minutes appreciating the GNOME design philosophy or flipping through their Human Interface Guidelines, they are on on the right track here.\nI came across this critique of GNOME the other day on Reddit. What\u0026rsquo;s been interesting is that the GNOME reddit community has been very supportive of the article, even prompting discussion within the GNOME team about interface changes. When I read the article, I thought he was far off the mark.\nThey might not have had threaded multitasking in Windows 95, but the the GUI concepts it introduced still hang around today. The icon-covered desktop is a good example. My father, from the moment he installed Windows 95, til this day running Mojave, has more desktop icons than desktop real estate. The Desktop also becomes a dumping ground for any and every file, the ever present drop point for everything you drag. \u0026lsquo;Create A Document\u0026rsquo; features lead to a sea of New Text Document (x).docx. Sometimes, what seems like a feature is really a curse.\nThe icon-laden desktop, which seems like a convenience, actually encourages disorganization. GNOME is a general purpose desktop environment, I sometimes use it on a laptop screen where I typically have a single maximized window. Sometimes dock it to my desktop ultra-wide monitor, where I\u0026rsquo;ll have multiple windows overlapping against the desktop background. Do I really want ugly icons poking out behind my windows, burning into my screen?\nGNOME solves the icon clutter by simply removing desktop icons altogether, and adopting a more mobile-like approach around the activities menu which is an overlay you can trigger with the Windows key, or a trackpad gesture, or touching the top-left corner with your mouse cursor. There you will find a Dock, a full screen applications menu, and a virtual desktop manager. Pretty much everything you could ask for in a DE. Except for the one issue the article didn\u0026rsquo;t address, the sobering lack of translucency and color in the core desktop experience. Microsoft and Apple infuses the background color into their UX, Adawata chose an off-grey color to nod to that effect. GNOME needs to start delivering the goods here.\nAnother real pain-point with gnome-shell is how it\u0026rsquo;s constantly fumbling notifications. Earlier releases of Gnome Shell, the 3.6\u0026rsquo;s and 3.8\u0026rsquo;s had a notification shelf on the bottom of the screen that was reminiscent of Chat Heads and honestly one of the best notification implementations I\u0026rsquo;ve used.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s since devolved into a something, I can hardly explain what at this point. 3.8 notifications were deserving of a better Chat app than Empathy. Perhaps Slack and Hipchat killed that momentum. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re back at the drawing board remaking it into a Macos/Windows-like Notification center that flies out from the right of the screen.\nNotifications spoke to a real problem, messages and notifications should be a first-class citizen, and application agnostic. This is the GNOME way, take the problems of yesteryear - namely that notifications in Empathy and programs like Xchat and Pidgin were a mess, and implement a DE-level solution as eloquently as possible. You still see this thinking everywhere with GNOME\u0026gt; Just open GNOME Boxes and compare it to Virtualbox. Look at how minimal the Files app is. With chat they fell short, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure they\u0026rsquo;ll try again.\nI have used GNOME for a long time, the lesson I learned when I decided to stop evaluating desktops was that desktop environments were generally short-sighted and will put a ton of effort in what amounts to dumb frivolous features and visual crap. When the parent DE shifts, it all gets thrown away, or worse, locked in place never to get upstream updates again. GNOME is a project that wants to shed old ideas, most desktop environments wants to collect them and package them as a greatest hits collection. That might appeal to some, but I prefer a desktop that\u0026rsquo;s thinking these things through.\n","ref":"/in-defense-of-gnome-3.32/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"So this year I bought a 3D printed tiny Super Nintendo Case and put a Raspberry Pi 3 in it. At first, my only concern was to have a RetroPie setup, because of my childhood love of legally obtained ROMs. This part was easy enough and obtainable in one sitting. Putting a RetroPie together is quick and easy, and those guys have really done a great job bridging the gap between a terminal driven configuration and controller-only input.\nTo my delight, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller supports Bluetooth and pairs right up to the Pi. The controller has a USB-C port for charging and is the best controller I own. I kicked my Xbox One out of the living room, so I almost live in a one controller world out there and it\u0026rsquo;s nice. Hopefully the new 8BITDO with USB-C will close that gap.\nMy first real hurdle with the Pi was a lack of decent HDMI CEC support. Natively, turning on a Pi will trigger an input switch, but these things tend to stay on all the time and that\u0026rsquo;s really no good when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to live without a TV Remote. This led to a udev rule that triggers it when a new input is detected. That was fun, a PR was made, a PR was rejected, and it suits my purposes. Eventually, it\u0026rsquo;ll get upstreamed.\nI had some friends over a few months ago, and we hooked a keyboard and mouse up to it and played with some DOS emulators. Sierra\u0026rsquo;s Kings Quest and Leisure Suit Larry made an appearance, as did civ1 and Orgeon\u0026rsquo;s Trail. Anything you could ever want to run in DOS Box runs on this thing wonderfully. It\u0026rsquo;s my experience that everything up to the PS1 and N64 is fair game, the N64 emulator is a little sticky but it\u0026rsquo;s not bad. Or so I heard.\nOne of the things I wanted immediately was the promise of never losing a save. In fact, I wanted to go a step further and take one traveling with me, and I wanted the save games to sync so I can pick up a game I was playing in the living room when I\u0026rsquo;m staying in a hotel overnight. So, as a bit of prep, I installed SyncThing on my NAS server and set up a share called \u0026ldquo;roms\u0026rdquo; which tracks the roms directory on the RetroPie. Beside my roms directory, I made a roms-iso where I keep the disk images I don\u0026rsquo;t want to store on my ROMs. I then mount these on my RetroPie via nfs, symlink in the appropriate rom-iso directories, and I let SyncThing copy over the romset. I do the same thing on my Traveler Pi, configure it so everything keeps sequential backups of all the files, and it works! Save a game on one, and before you have time to check it\u0026rsquo;s copied over to the other. I hope to never restart a game again because I forgot to backup before a format.\nThis year I spent a ton of time traveling and in hotels, and one thing that bothers me is that I can\u0026rsquo;t cast from my laptop to the TV using a Chromecast over the network. I bought the Microsoft Display Adapter which was nice when I had my Surface with me, but overall it was pretty crummy. But, I have a USB Wifi dongle that natively supports Linux, and so I installed Google Chrome on my Pi so I could do the web authentication for my hotel when I connected through the Pi\u0026rsquo;s wifi, and I configured hostapd to double the hotel\u0026rsquo;s wifi onto a Traveler Pi wifi network that didn\u0026rsquo;t have any of their authentication crap, enabling Google Chome to work. I was able to configure it in a way where it just kicks off when it detects the USB Dongle, it\u0026rsquo;s really fucking cool and I use it all the time.\nMy favorite thing the Pi does at the moment is Moonlight, the software that approximates Steam Link using the nVIDIA Experience setup. Other than kinks in the software where you\u0026rsquo;ll close a game and the Steam interface won\u0026rsquo;t restore and the like, this works really well. In the living room, I can go through the RetroPie, select \u0026lsquo;Steam\u0026rsquo; basically, it will load Big Picture on my PC in the other room and stream it to my living room. Pick any game I want and it kicks off and works. The devil here is in the controller mappings. I can\u0026rsquo;t et my Switch Pro controller\u0026rsquo;s analogs to work correctly, it\u0026rsquo;s not sensitive enough but Super Meat Boy works fine as it\u0026rsquo;s d-pad. The Steam Controller doesn\u0026rsquo;t work at all, but you can configure it through xboxdrv if you hate your life. I settled on using VirtualHere, which lets you virtually connect USB devices to other computers using the network. Works really well. The Xbox 360 controllers work well too, was showing off DOOM and Friday the 13th (for Windows) in the living room through Moonlight yesterday and it worked really well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crazy what you can do with these things, the only real limitation I\u0026rsquo;ve run into so far is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a SATA bus so you can\u0026rsquo;t use it as a NAS. It seems like a natural use case. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried any electronics projects with these things, but I may in the future try my hand at making some digital signage, something along the lines of light boards like you\u0026rsquo;d see at a football game or bingo hall.\n","ref":"/cool-uses-for-a-raspberry-pi/"},{"title":"Dell XPS 15 9550 Fedora 23 Guide","date":"","description":"","body":"I\u0026rsquo;m blessed with a job that\u0026rsquo;s actively looking to step up their hardware game. So after a few nights of googling, I went to our IT guy and I was able to pursuade him to order the new Dell XPS 15 Non-touch 9550 P56F. My model has a Intel Core i7-6700HQ with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512gb SSD on a PCI-e bus. Sickeningly awesome system. It hangs with my MBP but I still miss the trackpad. The MBP feels better and is less plastically, but the internals are better on the Dell side, and while it\u0026rsquo;s a little thicker than the MBP, it\u0026rsquo;s hardly noticable and Dell hides it pretty well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good Linux laptop. Running Fedora 23, it pretty much works entirely out of the box. Battery life seems roughly comparable to my MBP, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that pans out as I use it.\nMy thoughts so far:  Wireless: The Broadcom Wireless AC works well out of the gate. it connects to my 5GHz network, reconnects after standby, and seems speedy and reliable. Bluetooth: Scans, seemingly works Battery: Gnome reports 4-6 hours at 100% depending\u0026hellip; so far so good UEFI: Was able to perform the UEFI install and everything worked, did not try Secure Boot. Was having issues with hibernation in UEFI, might be user error. Regardless currently running in Legacy Mode. Suspend: Standby works reliably, wifi reconnects. Hibernation is a little flakier, tried configuring for hybrid-sleep, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rsquo;t get it to suspend but it would save RAM to disk and resume from hibernation Touchpad: Multitouch works! It\u0026rsquo;s very poorly configured, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much luck taming it, but with touchegg I\u0026rsquo;m able to do two finger right click, four finger swipe to show the activities menu\u0026hellip; but I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a lot of luck improving on that, must be a software thing because the touchpad seems well supported by the OS.  i still need to test a few things, and would like to get a better measure on the battery life. I\u0026rsquo;m interested to get the Dell Thunderbolt 3 Dock and see how that goes. Like the Surface Dock, it gives you one cable that charges the laptop and provides dual-head monitors, USB, Ethernet and everything.\nProvisioning You can get this to work with UEFI, but I ended up going Legacy boot since I was having problems getting standby and hibernate to work when booting through EFI. Also, make sure you set up a swap partion at least the size of your memory so hibernation will work.\nBumblebee/Nvidia Optimus The XPS 15 comes with both an Intel and Nvidia graphics controllers. The Intel GPU does the desktop stuff fine, but if you want to do any gaming you\u0026rsquo;ll want to switch over to the Nvidia. This isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to do, but it seems to render everything to a virtual frame buffer and probably isn\u0026rsquo;t as perforamnt as just using the nvidia card. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to setup though:\n  Bumblebee Indicator Gnome Extension\n  Bumblebee Installation Guide for Fedora\n  Basically, install as follows..\nAfter running all updates and restarting to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re running the latest kernel available to your system:\n$ dnf -y --nogpgcheck install http://install.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/yum/itecs/public/bumblebee/fedora23/noarch/bumblebee-release-1.2-1.noarch.rpm $ dnf -y --nogpgcheck install http://install.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/yum/itecs/public/bumblebee-nonfree/fedora23/noarch/bumblebee-nonfree-release-1.2-1.noarch.rpm $ dnf install bumblebee-nvidia bbswitch-dkms VirtualGL.x86_64 VirtualGL.i686 primus.x86_64 primus.i686 kernel-devel reboot When you want to use the Nvidia GPU, you need to pass the command through optirun, like follows:\n$ optirun glxspheres64 If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to run a game through Steam, be sure to update the launch command as follows:\noptirun $COMMAND (or whatever) Bluetooth Bluetooth did not work out the box for me, but it would scan and discover devices. Ultimately, I had to go through a whole deal to get it working, mostly following this guide\nMy struggle is your gain, if you have a Broadcom BCM2045 A0 you should be able to use something like the following to get this working:\n$ curl https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ajj26zj3n79pcc/BCM-0a5c-6410.hcd?dl=1 /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM-0a5c-6410.hcd You should test this by turning off your PC and turning it back on, as opposed to just restarting. You can determine where exactly to copy the firmware by using dmesg | grep btusb.\nTouch/Gestures This is a biggie for me, and a pain to setup. Luckily, the synaptics touchpad provided with the laptop supports all sorts of gestures in Linux but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to make some tweaks to get them to work.

It\u0026rsquo;s kinda like IR over HDMI. It allows the TV to auto-switch sources, turn on and off, all depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with the devices connected to it. The Chromecast turns on the display and switches input when you try and stream to it. My Steam Link will switch TV inputs and take control when I press the Steam button on the controller. This will replace the TV remote control by factoring it out entirely.\nIt turns out the PS4 also supports CEC, as does it\u0026rsquo;s predecessor the PS3. So imagine my surprise when I discover the Xbox One, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s pinnacle of Home Entertainment, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have this support baked in. Oh, the port in the back is compatible and the bundled cabling also supports it. The system reportedly even has some low-level awareness, probably even have the software update sitting on a server somewhere that enables it. Inexplicably, however, this feature is nowhere to be found. Instead, we have the Kinnect, a device that was once a next-generation human interface device that allowed you to use your xbox minority report style for when your controller is just out of reach. That is, until Microsoft released their NXE refresh a few months back and completely disabled the feature.\nSo, now the Kinnect\u0026rsquo;s primary usefulness is to log you in through the camera, voice commands like \u0026lsquo;Xbox Stop Listening\u0026rsquo;, and as an IR blaster to control your TV. Some people think that Microsoft is sitting on the CEC updates so they don\u0026rsquo;t undercut Kinnect more so, but as a Kinnect owner I\u0026rsquo;d really prefer they just implement all the functionality they can. The PS3 supports this stuff, after all.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not the only Xbox One feature that goes unused in my living room, the HDMI in port, something I thought was a huge differentiator when I decided to buy a next-gen console, was a lot cooler last year when I still had cable. For a moment, I wanted to hook my Chromecast into it, but alas with CEC it\u0026rsquo;s better to have it plugged into the TV.\nAll that to say that one little HDMI protocol tweak kinda devastates the Xbox One\u0026rsquo;s whole value proposition. Also considering the TV I bought supports Miracast, a feature Microsoft has kept in Preview for over a year, I\u0026rsquo;ve really started to question my decision to buy one of their stupid consoles. At least the PS4 doesn\u0026rsquo;t support 4K either, or else I would have already rage sold my One.\n","ref":"/hdmi-cec-gt-xbox-one/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"Finding a good (free) diff tool is hard for OS X. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll setup Meld (a popular diff tool on linux) to run with OS X and git.\nFirst, install a decent Mac build of Meld, there\u0026rsquo;s a few options but here\u0026rsquo;s one I really like:\nhttps://github.com/yousseb/meld/releases/tag/osx-v1\nOnce this is installed, you need to make bash script so Meld is command-line executable and can be invoke through git.

Google\u0026rsquo;s new Chromecast Audio gives me the makings of this, with the recent update it lets you place Chromecasts in a \u0026lsquo;group\u0026rsquo; where they all play simutaniously. In my house, I made such a group and named it \u0026lsquo;Everwhere\u0026rsquo;. You can play Youtube or Spotify to \u0026lsquo;everywhere\u0026rsquo; and in every room it starts playing (pretty much) in sync.\nI\u0026rsquo;m cheap though, and the only equipment I was willing to invest in is a couple of Chromecasts. Luckilly, I have computers in each room with decent speakers. So what I ended up doing was plugging the Chromecast Audio into my PC\u0026rsquo;s line-in and perform some software wizardtry to play the line-in feed through the speakers. This also gives you the ability to tune the system sound and chromecast sound. It\u0026rsquo;s all very trivial in Windows, as Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s supported this kind of thing since the dawn of time.\nTo get this working, select \u0026lsquo;Listen to this Device\u0026rsquo; in the Line Out properties.\nGetting this to work in Linux (Fedora 23 w/ Gnome 3.18) was a little tricker, but not by much. In my config, there\u0026rsquo;s not a menu option like \u0026lsquo;Listen to this Device\u0026rsquo;, but running the following in the terminal enables a \u0026lsquo;loopback\u0026rsquo; device that will play the line-out through your default speaker:\n$ pactl load-module module-loopback And boom, it starts working! You may need to tweak the sound settings so this sounds good, but you can control the volue through software and play the chromcast stream mixed with your system audio. It works pretty well, and really completes the solution as far as multi-room sound goes.\nBut wait, you restarted your box and the settings didn\u0026rsquo;t persist, huh? Well, I have an autostart entry that solves this problem:\nIn ~/.config/autostart/lineout.desktop\n[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=lineout mods Exec=pactl load-module module-loopback Comment=pushes line-in to the default out for Chromecast Audio support Terminal=false OnlyShowIn=GNOME The constraint here is that it only starts when logged in. There\u0026rsquo;s probably a better way to invoke this. If I figure it out, i\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to update!\nI was also running into some crackling and distortions. To rememdy, I plugged the Chromecast Audio directly into the wall with the supplied USB wall outlet. Apperantly powering from my PC\u0026rsquo;s USB port is no good and was adding a ton of distortions.\n","ref":"/chromcast-audio-to-pc-line-in-as-multi-room-solution/"},{"title":"","date":"","description":"","body":"Logitech\u0026rsquo;s MX Master is perhaps one of the best mice available at the moment.

Unfortunately, the default key mappings on my linux desktop (Gnome 3) are terrible. The thumb button doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything, and the vertical scroll does god knows what.\nThe vertical scroll button is a little harder to configure. Personally, I want the vertical scroll to do page zooming.\nIn Fedora 23, I had to install the following packages:\n$ sudo dnf install xautomation xbindkeys xbindkeys is a daemon that lets you remap keybindings. xautomation contains xte, which is a little app that let\u0026rsquo;s you emulate keystrokes. Using the two, we can remap the mouse buttons to simulate\nand give xbindkeys the following config:\nsomewhere inside ~/.xbindkeysrc\n#zoom-in \u0026#34;xte \u0026#39;keydown Control_L\u0026#39; \u0026#39;keydown Shift_L\u0026#39; \u0026#39;key plus\u0026#39; \u0026#39;keyup Shift_L\u0026#39; \u0026#39;keyup Control_L\u0026#39;\u0026#34; b:6 #zoom-out \u0026#34;xte \u0026#39;keydown Control_L\u0026#39; \u0026#39;key minus\u0026#39; \u0026#39;keyup Control_L\u0026#39;\u0026#34; b:7 I\u0026rsquo;m emulating ctrl+shift+plus for Zoom out in order to respect the default Zoom Out bindings for nautilus.
