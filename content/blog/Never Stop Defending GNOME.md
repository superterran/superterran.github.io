I started using GNOME 40 about a month back, just as Fedora 34 went into beta. The latest release is really something great. Huge fan of the gorgeous activities overview. I even went so far as to create a module called [Clear Top Bar](https://github.com/superterran/gnome-shell-extension-clear-top-bar) for it, too. 

I'm also getting a lot of use out of [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)), which initially I thought wouldn't make it look that much greater but really does seem to elevate things. [Bottom triggers Activities overview](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4120/bottom-triggers-activities-overview/) is another favorite, this predictably sets a new hot-trigger when you move the mouse to the bottom of the screen, where the dock is now placed. Really ties the whole interface together.

The overviews interface is clearly the biggest improvement, but I also like the new power management profiles they have baked into the settings menu, and finally being able to organize the apps menu is nice as well. In all, GNOME seems to be tracking well with Mac OS releases and they have currently caught us to OS X Lion. 

This is a great release, but still - would it kill the GNOME team to introduce some concept of translucent blur
